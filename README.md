# Distributed Machine Learning Patterns

This repository contains references and code for my book *Distributed Machine Learning Patterns* from Manning Publications.

:fire: The book is now available on the Manning Early Access Program [here](https://www.manning.com/books/distributed-machine-learning-patterns). You can read the book chapter-by-chapter while it's being written and get the final eBook as soon as it's finished. If you pre-order the pBook, you'll get it long before it's available in stores.

The code listings in this book is available [here](code).
